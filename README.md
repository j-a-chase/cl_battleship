# Overview

I made this project to enhance my skills with C++! When I first started college, my first class involved a simple CLI battleship game project that ended up going very poorly for me. As I thought about a project to enhance my skills, this shot at redemption sounded great! I hadn't used C++ for a long time, and I decided that building this project object-oriented would be the way to go, instead of procedurally like I had first done. After scraping off the rust, I was able to design this one-player Battleship game!

This program is designed to allow you to hide your ships, and then begin the main game loop. The main loop involves you taking a turn to pick row and column coordinates to 'fire' at, followed by the CPU then having a turn to pick. Once all ships are destroyed on one side, the game is over!

This software expanded my C++ capabilities and helped me learn quite a lot as well! It required me to learn how to return a 2D array in C++, as well as required me to figure out my own function for validating user input to prevent crashes. It also left plenty of room to continue work on it and expand upon the features already available!

# Development Environment

I used C++, requiring Microsoft Visual Studio development tools, as well as VSCode with the proper implementation to use C++ in it!

# Future Work

- Add randomization to enemy ship placement
- Add enemy AI for shots
- Add difficulty toggle
- Add color to the console outputs to make the game prettier
